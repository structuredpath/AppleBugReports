# Deprecation of CloudKit user discoverability APIs in iOS 17

- Platform: iOS
- Area: CloudKit
- Type: Suggestion

In iOS 17, all CloudKit APIs for discovering users have been deprecated (including `CKDiscoverAllUserIdentitiesOperation`), leaving no documented way to create social experiences similar to Apple’s first-party apps. We’d like to ask for guidance on how to implement such experiences or replacement APIs that would allow the discoverability of users in a third-party app.
