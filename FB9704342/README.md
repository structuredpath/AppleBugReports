# Oversized image/PDF prints & missing scaling options in the Shortcut Print action

## Description
Hello Apple Feedback Team,

When using the system “Print” Shortcuts-Action with large images or PDF’s, the image/graphic gets scaled too much resulting in a cut off print. Neither the print dialog nor the action offer options to change rotation or scaling. Therefore there is no way to fix this issue.

The attached “Shortcut Setup.png” file shows the shortcut setup as well as the following list:

### Shortcut Setup
1. Take Screenshot
2. Make PDF from Screenshot
3. Print PDF

### Actual Results
The attached image “Screenshot showing the Issue.png” shows the print dialog shown by the “Print” action. As you can see the actual image input (a PDF generated from a screenshot) is scaled too much and this gets cut off at the paper borders. Neither the print dialog nor the shortcut action itself offer options to change this. Therefore I am practically unable to print images!
This issue is also apparent with other larger bitmap-images or PDF files.

### Expected
1. First I’d expect that the image get’s automatically scaled down to fit the sheet.
2. To further give users more options I’d also expect the print dialog to have options for scaling & rotation similar to Preview’s print dialog (see “Preview Print Dialog.png”)
3. The “Print” shortcut action ideally directly offers those before mentioned options via “Show More.”
